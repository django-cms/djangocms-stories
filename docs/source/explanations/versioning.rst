  - Each edit creates a new content version
  - Publish workflow for content approval
  - Version comparison tools
  - Audit trail for all changes

Version States
==============

**Draft State**
  - Editable working version
  - Not visible to public users
  - Can have multiple draft versions
  - Author workspace for content creation

**Published State**
  - Live content visible to users
  - Read-only for content editors
  - SEO and caching optimized
  - Stable reference for links

**Archived State**
  - Historical versions
  - Preserved for compliance
  - Reference for content recovery
  - Audit trail maintenance

Content Lifecycle
==================

**Creation Workflow**
  1. Author creates draft version
  2. Content development and editing
  3. Review process (optional)
  4. Publication approval
  5. Live content serving

**Update Workflow**

**Version Hooks**
  Custom behavior on version events::

    from django.dispatch import receiver

    @receiver(post_publish)
    def notify_on_publish(sender, version, **kwargs):
        if isinstance(version.content, PostContent):
            # Send notifications
            # Update search index
            # Trigger webhooks
            pass

**Approval Workflows**
  Multi-stage approval process::

    class ApprovalWorkflow:
        def __init__(self, post_content):
            self.content = post_content

        def submit_for_review(self, user):
            # Mark for editorial review
            # Notify reviewers
            # Lock for further editing
            pass

        def approve(self, reviewer):
            # Mark as approved
            # Ready for publication
            # Notify author
            pass

**Custom Version States**
  Extended state machine::

    class ExtendedVersionState(VersionState):
        NEEDS_REVIEW = 'needs_review'
        APPROVED = 'approved'
        REJECTED = 'rejected'

        CHOICES = VersionState.CHOICES + [
            (NEEDS_REVIEW, 'Needs Review'),
            (APPROVED, 'Approved'),
            (REJECTED, 'Rejected'),
